To Mrs. Saville, England
St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—
You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied
the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings. I arrived here yesterday, and
my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and
increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.
I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the
streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play
upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me
with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze,
which has travelled from the regions towards which I am
advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more
fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the
pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight.
There, Margaret, the sun is forever visible, its broad disk just
skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour.
There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust
in preceding navigators— there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to
a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region
hitherto discovered on the habitable globe.
