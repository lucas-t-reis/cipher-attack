Certainly not but if you observe people always live forever when there is an annuity to be paid them and she is very stout and healthy and hardly forty An annuity is a very serious business it comes over and over every year and there is no getting rid of it You are not aware of what you are doing I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my fathers will and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it Twice every year these annuities were to be paid and then there was the trouble of getting it to them and then one of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing My mother was quite sick of it Her income was not her own she said with such perpetual claims on it and it was the more unkind in my father because otherwise the money would have been entirely at my mothers disposal without any restriction whatever It has given me such an of annuities that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world
